    /*!
     An action queue is used to allow a variety of actions to be queued on a single thread.
     Each action, added by one of the addAction() methods, will be run as soon as possible
     after its target delay. If the delay is the value asap (or any other duration that maps
     to zero) the action will be run as soon as possible.

     The key advantage of this over, for example, a thread looping with a wait_for() call,
     is that multiple timed things can be added, all shared with a single thread. In
     particular, if you have two or three threads that each loop and call wait_for(), you
     can replace them with a single instance of this class (and its single thread) and
     its helpers. (See TimedActionGenerator.)

     Another use of an action queue is to serialize accesses to some resource. That is,
     instead of accessing your resource directly, add actions that access it to the
     action queue. Since the action queue operates in a single thread, this ensures that
     the access will always be serialized without the need to managing locks. (Or more
     accurately, by relying on the ActionQueue internal locks.)
