             RAII (Resource acquisition is initialization) is used to implement the RAII
             pattern without always having to create a custom class.

             You give this class two lambdas. The first is the setup code which is run
             by the class constructor. The second is the cleanup code which is run by the
             class destructor. Hence the RAII pattern, the setup runs when the object
             comes into scope and the cleanup when it goes out of scope.

             This is structured like the following:

             <pre>
             {
                 RAII myRAII([&]{
                    cout << "this gets run at setup" << endl;
                 }, [&]{
                    cout << "this gets run at cleanup" << endl;
                 });

                 cout << "this is my application code" << endl;
             }
             </pre>

             This would produce the following output:

             <pre>
                this gets run at setup
                this is my application code
                this gets run at cleanup
             </pre>
             */

                 executed in the destructor.
