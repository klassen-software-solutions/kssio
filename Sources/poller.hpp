         This is the interface for the poller delegate. A delegate must be provided
         for a poller to do anything useful. The delegate is divided into two sections,
         one that controls the operation of the poller and one that responds to the
         availability of the resources.

         It is best that the methods of this interface do not throw exceptions. However
         if they do they will be automatically caught and ignored.

             (or select) call should wait before returning a result. The smaller the
             value, the more responsive the system is to stopping and to monitored
             resources being added and removed. However the smaller the value is the
             closer Poller::run() is to a "busy wait." For most applications the
             default given here (100ms) is likely a fairly good value.

             Although it probably isn't a great idea, this method can return different
             values at different times. The new value will come into effect the next
             time that the internal poll completes and is called again.

             std::chrono::duration::none - No waiting is performed. The poller becomes
             a "busy wait."
             std::chrono::milliseconds::max - No timeout is used. The poller will
             wait forever unless these is an event on one of the resources
             forcing it to check again.

             Run the poller. This will not exit until one of the following occurs:

             - The delegate's pollerShouldStop() returned true and the internal poll
             was completed either due to a timeout or an event occuring. (In the
             latter case, the delegate callbacks will be called before pollerShouldStop()
             will be examined. Assuming that the maximum wait interval is not infinite,
             this should be the normal exit condition.

             - There are no resources to monitor. This would be unusual, but if you
             are calling add and remove during the run, it is possible. You would then
             need to manually determine when to call run again, presumably after
             adding at least one resource to monitor.

             - The internal poll call reports an EINTR signal. This would be the case
             if you have your thead configured to be interruptable and it got
             interrupted. If you really need to check for this (say because you want
             to throw an exception), you can see if (errno == EINTR) as soon as
             run() exits and before you make any system calls.

             - An error occurs during the internal poll call. In this case run will
             exit by throwing a system_error exception.

             @throws runtime_error if no delegate has been assigned or there is some other
             problem while running.
