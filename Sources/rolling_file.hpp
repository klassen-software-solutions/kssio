    /*!
     The RollingFileListener class is an interface (pure virtual class) that can be used
     to receive notifications when a file is opened or closed. This is useful if you wish
     to write a prefix or suffix to each file, or perhaps to update header values before
     the file is actually closed. It can also be used just to find out when events occur.

     Note that all the methods default to do nothing, hence subclasses need only
     override the ones of interest.

     Also note that any exceptions thrown will be passed up through the RollingFile
     class.
